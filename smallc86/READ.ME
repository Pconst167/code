This is a port from Ron Cain's original work. 

It is in *.LBR form and included is a shareware unpacker, 
CFX.EXE - It should also unpack under CP/M-86 with the LU86.CMD

This works quite easily on a IBM PC (CP/M-86 1.1)   
It emits *.a86 assembly and is ready for ASM86 and GENCMD 

(unlike the DRC -it keeps barfing: 'needs link86 1.1 or later'.)
